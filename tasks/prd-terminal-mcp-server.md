# Product Requirements Document: Terminal MCP Server

## Introduction/Overview

The Terminal MCP Server is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides full terminal and system access capabilities to AI agents. This server will enable an AI Coding Agent to execute any command-line operations, manage processes, execute Python scripts, and perform system-level tasks through a secure and robust MCP interface.

The primary goal is to give AI agents the same level of terminal access that a human developer would have, enabling autonomous development, debugging, file management, and system administration tasks.

## Goals

1. **Full Terminal Access**: Provide complete command-line interface capabilities through MCP tools
2. **Process Management**: Enable comprehensive process lifecycle management including background processes
3. **Real-time Communication**: Stream command outputs and errors in real-time to the AI agent
4. **Python Integration**: Support Python script execution with dependency management and virtual environment handling
5. **System Integration**: Allow full system access for development and debugging tasks
6. **Reliability**: Ensure robust error handling and process management
7. **Performance**: Minimize latency for command execution and output streaming

5. **As an AI Coding Agent**, I want to monitor and control running processes so that I can manage system resources effectively
6. **As an AI Coding Agent**, I want to handle command errors gracefully so that I can debug and retry operations

### Secondary User Stories
1. **As an AI Coding Agent**, I want to switch between virtual environments so that I can work with different Python projects
2. **As an AI Coding Agent**, I want to capture and process command exit codes so that I can determine success/failure states
3. **As an AI Coding Agent**, I want to set environment variables so that I can configure execution contexts
4. **As an AI Coding Agent**, I want to work with different working directories so that I can organize project work
